# Overview

The player controlls a bird in the sky and has to either knock the boxes over the monsters' heads or directly collide with the monsters to move onto the next level.

I created this game to introduce me in C# and game development.

# Development Environment

Unity Game Engine - Unity allowed me to create a game from scrach. It allowed me to create levels and automatically create gravity and collision for all the objects.

C# - I used C# to do all the coding in Unity. This allowed me to create objects and statements that allowed the user to alter the environment and control the bird. C# allowed the user to continue on to next levels.
